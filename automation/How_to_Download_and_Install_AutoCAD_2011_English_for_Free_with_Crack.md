AutoCAD 2011 also offers some new features and enhancements for 2D drawing productivity. Some of them are:

- Object visibility. You can isolate or hide selected objects without changing their layer properties. This can help you focus on the objects you need to work on and reduce clutter on the screen.
- Object selection. You can select similar objects based on their properties, such as layer, color, linetype, etc. This can save you time and clicks when you need to modify a group of objects with the same characteristics.
- Object creation. You can create new objects with the same properties as an existing object by using the Add Selected tool. This can help you maintain consistency and accuracy in your drawings.

AutoCAD 2011 also introduces some new features and enhancements for 3D modeling and visualization. Some of them are:

- Surface modeling. You can create and edit complex surfaces with more control and flexibility. You can use tools such as loft, sweep, revolve, extrude, and offset to create smooth or mesh surfaces from curves, edges, or other surfaces.
- Surface analysis. You can analyze the continuity, curvature, draft, and zebra stripes of surfaces to check their quality and smoothness. You can also use the new materials browser to apply realistic materials to your 3D models.
- Point cloud support. You can attach point cloud files to your drawings and use them as references for creating or modifying 3D models. You can also snap to points, filter points, and adjust point cloud density and color.
